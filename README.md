# About project

For now it's in **Work In Progress** state, which means, there almost **nothing** done... sorry. Right now, it's can only create collision code, if you already have your own onescreen platformer engine, use can use it.

But, in near future, i hope, you will see easy to use studio to make one screen platformers for Sega Genesis.

# What done:

- Collision Map Editor
- Collision Array Generator
- Ability to draw rect (press Shift) in Collsion Mode
- Entity Editor (almost done)

# What should be done:

- Entity system like in LDTK
- Ability to change sprite of entity (not like in LDTK)
- Ability to change code of entity in VS Code.
- Compile & Run button in BlastEm
- Link between Levels
- Save & Load System
- and more...
